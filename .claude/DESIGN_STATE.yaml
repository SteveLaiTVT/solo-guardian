# 3. API Design Constraints

api_constraints:

# ============================================================
# 4. Code Constraints (For B/C Session validation)
# ============================================================
code_constraints:
  general:
    - "No `any` type allowed (TypeScript)"
    - "All functions must have return type declaration"
    - "Single file < 300 lines"
    - "Single function < 50 lines"
    
  backend:
    - "Controller only does parameter validation and calls Service"
    - "Service contains business logic, does not directly access database"
    - "Repository handles database operations"
    - "All database operations must be in transactions"
    - "Sensitive operations must be logged"
    
  frontend:
    - "Use functional components + Hooks"
    - "Extract business logic to custom hooks"
    - "Separate UI components from business components"
    - "All API calls through api-client package"
    
  mobile:
    - "Separate UI from business logic (Compose + ViewModel)"
    - "Use StateFlow/SharedFlow for state management"
    - "Network requests through Repository layer"

# ============================================================
decision_log:
  - id: "ADR-001"
    date: "2026-01-14"
    decision: "Use Monorepo structure"
    rationale: "Easier type sharing, better AI context understanding"

  - id: "ADR-002"
    date: "2026-01-14"
    decision: "Backend uses NestJS"
    rationale: "Modular design, native TypeScript support, easy type sharing with frontend"

  - id: "ADR-003"
    date: "2026-01-14"
    decision: "Use feature branches for iterations"
    rationale: "Keep main branch stable, feature/iter-XXX for development"
