# 7. Architecture Decision Records (ADR Log)
# ============================================================
decision_log:
  - id: "ADR-001"
    date: "2026-01-14"
    decision: "Use Monorepo structure"
    rationale: "Easier type sharing, better AI context understanding"

  - id: "ADR-002"
    date: "2026-01-14"
    decision: "Backend uses NestJS"
    rationale: "Modular design, native TypeScript support, easy type sharing with frontend"

  - id: "ADR-003"
    date: "2026-01-14"
    decision: "Use feature branches for iterations"
    rationale: "Keep main branch stable, feature/iter-XXX for development"

  - id: "ADR-004"
    date: "2026-01-14"
    decision: "Check-in uses date-based uniqueness (one per day)"
    rationale: |
      - User can only check in once per day (no duplicate check-ins)
      - Check-in date stored as DATE type (not timestamp) for easy querying
      - Allows "re-check-in" by updating existing record
      - Simplifies "did user check in today?" queries

  - id: "ADR-005"
    date: "2026-01-14"
    decision: "Check-in settings default to 10:00 deadline if not set"
    rationale: |
      - New users should have sensible defaults
      - 10:00 AM is a reasonable morning deadline
      - User can customize after registration

  - id: "ADR-006"
    date: "2026-01-14"
    decision: "Use NestJS Passport JWT strategy for authentication"
    rationale: |
      - Standard pattern for NestJS JWT authentication
      - JwtAuthGuard for protecting routes
      - CurrentUser decorator for extracting user from token
      - Consistent with NestJS ecosystem

  - id: "ADR-007"
    date: "2026-01-15"
    decision: "User-web uses Vite + React + shadcn/ui + Tailwind"
    rationale: |
      - Vite for fast development and build
      - shadcn/ui for accessible, customizable components
      - Tailwind for mobile-first responsive design
      - TanStack Query for server state management
      - Zustand for client state (auth tokens)

  - id: "ADR-008"
    date: "2026-01-15"
    decision: "Shared API client package (@solo-guardian/api-client)"
    rationale: |
      - Type-safe API calls matching backend
      - Automatic token refresh handling
      - Shared between user-web and admin-web
      - TanStack Query hooks for data fetching

  - id: "ADR-009"
    date: "2026-01-15"
    decision: "Use react-i18next for internationalization"
    rationale: |
      - Most popular i18n solution for React
      - Excellent TypeScript support
      - Namespace-based organization (auth, dashboard, settings, history)
      - Built-in language detection and persistence
      - Interpolation support for dynamic values
    languages:
      - "en: English (default)"
      - "zh: Chinese Simplified"
      - "ja: Japanese"

  - id: "ADR-010"
    date: "2026-01-15"
    decision: "Emergency contacts with priority ordering and 5-contact limit"
    rationale: |
      - Each user can have up to 5 emergency contacts
      - Contacts have priority order (1-5) for notification sequence
      - Contact types: email (MVP), phone/SMS (future)
      - Contacts must be verified before activation (future)
      - Soft delete to preserve notification history
    schema:
      fields:
        - "id: UUID primary key"
        - "userId: FK to User"
        - "name: Contact's name"
        - "email: Contact's email address"
        - "phone: Optional phone number (future)"
        - "priority: 1-5 ordering"
        - "isVerified: Boolean (default false)"
        - "isActive: Boolean (default true)"
        - "createdAt, updatedAt, deletedAt"

  - id: "ADR-011"
    date: "2026-01-15"
    decision: "Feature toggle system with preferFeaturesOn flag"
    rationale: |
      - No user labeling (no "elder"/"young" mode)
      - Users choose features they want
      - preferFeaturesOn: auto-enable new features on upgrade or not
      - Core features as DB columns (queryable)
      - Optional features in JSON field (flexible, no schema changes)
    schema:
      fields:
        - "id: UUID primary key"
        - "userId: FK to User (unique)"
        - "preferFeaturesOn: Boolean (default false)"
        - "fontSize: Int (14-24, default 16)"
        - "highContrast: Boolean (default false)"
        - "reducedMotion: Boolean (default false)"
        - "hobbyCheckIn: Boolean (default false)"
        - "familyAccess: Boolean (default false)"
        - "optionalFeatures: JSON (flexible storage)"
        - "onboardingCompleted: Boolean (default false)"
        - "createdAt, updatedAt"

  - id: "ADR-012"
    date: "2026-01-15"
    decision: "Standardized error handling with i18n support"
    rationale: |
      - Error codes shared between backend and frontend (packages/types)
      - Error categories: VALIDATION, AUTH, BUSINESS, NOT_FOUND, CONFLICT, RATE_LIMIT, SYSTEM
      - Backend: BusinessException + GlobalExceptionFilter
      - Frontend: useErrorHandler hook + i18n error messages
      - User errors get friendly messages, system errors get apologetic messages
      - Error response includes i18nKey for frontend translation
    error_response_format:
      success: false
      error:
        code: "AUTH_1001"
        category: "AUTH"
        message: "English default message"
        i18nKey: "error.auth.invalidCredentials"
        details: {}
        field: "email"
        timestamp: "2026-01-15T10:00:00Z"
